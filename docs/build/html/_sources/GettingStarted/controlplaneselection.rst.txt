Checklist For Potential Control Plane Servers
=============================================

* Stable internet connection

* Operating System: RedHat 8.3 or Rocky 8

* Root (/) and Var (/var) have a minimum of 50% (~35G) free space

* PowerCap policy is disabled

* BIOS system profile is set to 'Performance'

* Root privilege is available

* Python 3.6 or 3.8 is installed ::

    dnf install epel-release -y

    dnf install python3 -y

.. note:: To deploy Omnia, Python provides bindings to system tools such as RPM, DNF, and SELinux.

* Ansible is installed

    Verify if Ansible is already installed by running ``ansible --version``. If version 2.9 or later is installed, uninstall it before installing a newer version using the following commands. ::

        pip uninstall ansible

        pip uninstall ansible-base (if ansible 2.9 is installed)

        pip uninstall ansible-core` (if ansible 2.10 > version is installed)

    .. Warning:: Omnia does not support Ansible versions greater than 6.0.0.

    To install Ansible, run the following commands. ::


        pip3.6 install --upgrade pip

        pip3.8 install --upgrade pip

        python3.6 -m pip install ansible

        python3.8 -m pip install ansible==5.10.0

    After the installation is complete, run ``ansible --version`` to verify if the installation is successful. In the output, ensure that the executable location path is present in the PATH variable by running ``echo $PATH``.

    If executable location path is not present, update the path by running ``export PATH=$PATH:<executable location>\``.

    For example, ::


        ansible -- version

        ansible 2.10.9

        config file = None

        configured module search path = ['/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']

        ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible

        executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible

        python version = 3.6.8 (default, Aug 24 2020, 17:57:11) [GCC 8.3.1 20191121 (Red Hat 8.3.1-5)]


The executable location is ``/usr/local/bin/ansible``. Update the path by running the following command:

    ``export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin``
