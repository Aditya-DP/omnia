Roles
=====

From Omnia 1.4, all of Omnia's many features are available via roles. Roles allow users to to choose different features and customize their deployment journey individual to their needs. Alternatively, all features can be invoked using the three top level scripts:

1. `Control_plane.yml <../RunningControlPlane/index>`_

2. `Omnia.yml <../RunningOmnia/index>`_

Below is a list of all Omnia's roles:
