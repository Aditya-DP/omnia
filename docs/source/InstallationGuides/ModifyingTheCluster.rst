Adding a new node
+++++++++++++++++

A new node can be added using one of two ways:

1. Using a mapping file:

    * Update the existing mapping file by appending the new entry (without the disrupting the older entries) or provide a new mapping file by pointing ``pxe_mapping_file_path`` in ``provision_config.yml`` to the new location.

    * Run ``provision.yml``.

2. Using the switch IP:

    * Run ``provision.yml`` once the switch has discovered the potential new node.
