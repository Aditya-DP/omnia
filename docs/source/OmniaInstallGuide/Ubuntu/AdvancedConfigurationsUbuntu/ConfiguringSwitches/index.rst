Configuring switches
=====================

.. note::

    * Omnia is specifically designed to support the configuration of Ethernet switches that run on the Dell SmartFabric OS10 network operating system.
    * If you are using Ethernet switches that run on a free and open-source network operating system like SONiC OS, it is important to note that the configuration process will need to be done manually by users.
