# example postscript to tune ml interface for improved stability and performance

chdev -l mlt0 -a agg_killtime=-1  2>/dev/null    # allow "agg_interval" and "agg_threshold" to default

# The effect of the above is that complete ml route entries last forever, incomplete entries time out
# in 40 seconds, and there are no keepalive probes for complete entries (to reduce OS jitter).

# The following is also recommended to improve balance across hf interfaces (assuming sequential ml
# addressing, at least within each drawer). Note that "agg_hash"  must be set PRIOR to the ml interface
# being configured.

chdev -l mlt0 -a agg_hash=2  2>/dev/null
